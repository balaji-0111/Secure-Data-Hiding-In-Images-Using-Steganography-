# 🖼️ SECURE DATA HIDING IN IMAGES USING STEGANOGRAPHY 🔐

Welcome to the **Secure data hiding in images using steganography**! This project demonstrates how to hide secret messages within an image using steganography techniques. The message is encrypted using a **Caesar Cipher** and embedded into randomly selected pixels of the image. Perfect for secure communication! 🚀

---

## 🌟 Features

- **🔒 Encryption**: Encrypts the secret message using a Caesar Cipher.
- **🎲 Random Pixel Selection**: Hides the message in randomly selected pixels for added security.
- **🔐 Password Protection**: Uses SHA-256 hashing to secure the passcode.
- **📤 Decryption**: Retrieves and decrypts the hidden message with the correct passcode.
- **🖼️ Image Manipulation**: Uses OpenCV to process and save the encrypted image.

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:

- **Python 3.8 or higher** 🐍
- **OpenCV** (`opencv-python-headless`) 📦

Install the required libraries using:

pip install opencv-python-headless



🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-steganography.git

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
cd image-steganography

3. Add Your Image
Place your image file (e.g., mypic.jpg) in the project directory.

4. Run the Script
Execute the script to start the steganography process:
python steganography.py

🖥️ Usage

Encrypting a Message

1. Run the script:
python steganography.py

2. Enter your secret message when prompted.

3. Enter a passcode for encryption.

4. The encrypted image will be saved as encryptedImg.jpg.

Decrypting a Message

1. Run the script again:
python steganography.py

2. Enter the passcode used during encryption.

3. If the passcode is correct, the hidden message will be displayed.

🧑‍💻 Example

Enter secret message: Hello, World! 🌍
Enter a passcode: mypassword
Encrypted image saved as encryptedImg.jpg

Enter passcode for Decryption: mypassword
Decrypted message: Hello, World! 🌍

🛡️ Security Notes

Password Strength: Use a strong passcode to ensure security.

Image Quality: The encrypted image may have slight quality loss due to pixel manipulation.

Randomization: The message is hidden in random pixels, making it harder to detect.
